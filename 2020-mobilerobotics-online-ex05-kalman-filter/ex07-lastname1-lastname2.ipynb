    "In the lecture you got to know the Kalman Filter as a realization of the Bayes filter where you assume a linear model and gaussian distributed noise. In this exercise, you need to estimate the height and velocity of a falling object in ${R}^1$ recursively for specific time intervals of $t=1$ seconds.\n",

    "Assume the initial state of the object to be given by its height $y=95.5$ m and velocity $v=0$ $\\frac{m}{s}$ and corresponding uncertainties $\\sigma_y^2=0.25$ and $\\sigma_v^2=0.05$. We assume a motion with uniform acceleration of $a=1$ $\\frac{m}{s^2}$ which we will treat as a control command. In addition, you observe the height of the falling object for five consecutive time steps $z = [96.4, 95.9, 94.4, 87.7, 85.3]$ m with $\\sigma_z^2=0.5$.\n",

    "For each time step visualize the predicted heigth of $\\bar{\\mathbf{x}}_t$, the observation $\\mathbf{z}_t$ and the posteriori state estimate $\\mathbf{x}_t$. Plot time steps on the x-axis and height on the y-axis. (6)\n",
